As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different background and at different settings .
<t>We may meet only once but we exchange our [contact numbers] as well as facebook [account] in order to keep in touch .</t>
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like facebook is a great way for friends from different field or even from different parts of the world to be connected .

When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it .
<t>If they do not want to think too much [of] it and view it as a [trouble] , they may just ignore the possibility .</t>
However , if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers .

Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases , given in the context of current medical technology .
<t>For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is [being] [realised] [in] [the] early stage .</t>
Hence , with the knowledge of having genetic risk , the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might save them in realising it at a earlier stage .

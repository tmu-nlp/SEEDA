In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives about this .
<t>This is because his or her relatives have the right to know about this .</t>
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .

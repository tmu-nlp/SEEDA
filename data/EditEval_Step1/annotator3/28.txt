While every family need to go through this or that kind of troublesome situations , the more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding .
<t>Hence , for a family in which every member [is] truly [believing] in each other and [loving] each other [,all] these troubles are just [testaments] to make them stronger .</t>
Just as the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson , what does n't kill you make you stronger .

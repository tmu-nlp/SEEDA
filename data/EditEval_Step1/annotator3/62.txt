I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them .
<t>Furthermore , as it could [incur spending] a [lots] of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be [the] burden [in] [her] family .</t>
I could understand the feeling of the carrier .

Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
What is genetic risk ?
Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
People get certain diseases because of genetic changes .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chances of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you will definitely develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you will develop heart disease .
However , for some rare diseases , people with certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
When we are diagnosed with a certain genetic disease , are we supposed to disclose these results to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
On the one hand , we do not want this potential danger to cause frightening effects in our families ' lives later on .
When people around us know that we have certain diseases , their attitudes will easily change , whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us .
And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted and worry about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us throughout our whole lives , because we will never know when the " potential bomb " will explode .
On the other hand , if there are ways that can help us to control or cure the disease , we can go through these processes from the scope of the whole family .
For example , if exercising is helpful to stave off potential diseases in the family , we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise .
And we keep track of the health conditions of all family members .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when other members get this disease .
Here I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to their siblings , there is currently no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate their own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious .
" "
Nothing is absolutely right or wrong .
If certain genetic disease tests are very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and be known by others , it is OK to disclose the results .
Above all , life is more important than secrets .
Genetic risk carries its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
After all , what affects one family may or may not affect another even though the families have a common genetic makeup , shared by either of the parents .
In cases where an individual has become aware of a genetic disorder , disclosing it to their relative is solely a matter of preference within the individual 's moral system .
The issue of whether or not to know one 's genetic risks is highly debatable because although the information might come from one 's parents ' extended family-their maternal and paternal uncles , aunts , or cousins-one can never be entirely sure .
This also means that as soon as a person is made aware of their genetic profile , they concurrently have knowledge about others .
This knowledge may be relevant to them , and vice versa .
An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer .
It is hereditary .
Should someone who suffered from this disease keep it a secret or inform their relatives ?
In retrospect , it is also one 's duty to ensure that he or she undergo periodic health checks .
Sometimes family structures and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from – for example , the son or daughter – the parents who know about this would decide who gets told and who takes precedence in being ' allowed ' to tell .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , even adult at-risk ones .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they might not want to know .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
The notion of authority also extended ' vertically ' .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself , while the aunt is .
From a practitioner 's perspective , these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are social constructs , they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assist those at risk to make informed decisions about disclosure .
Whose duty it is to inform at-risk relatives or not greatly depends on their personal morality and the nature of how ' directive ' the risk is to them .
People with close blood relation generally carry some similar genes .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry a genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell their close relatives about the issue and let others know about the risk so that their family members are able to perform some necessary exercises to prevent the potential disease or they may go to the hospital and check for the corresponding tests .
In my opinion , although the announcement of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self-privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell their relatives in order for them to prevent potential diseases .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
Focus on the negative aspects of the disclosure of genetic risk first .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicate their high chance of carrying certain diseases .
Especially for the young people without marriage , if he / she is known to have some genetic risk , it may have a chance that his / her child would carry the same disease , but not for certain .
Therefore , keeping the information secret from their future spouse would help the relationship .
Secondly , announcing the potential risk would cause the family members to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future , thus going to hospital and doing additional checks or taking more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creates unnecessary costs for the family .
Furthermore , the announcement of genetic risk would affect the relationship with relatives , as sometimes others may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get the potential disease .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extent and help to maintain their privacy , it has much larger negative impacts on the family members and relatives .
First , in the case of marriage , people should be honest and tell their spouse they may carry certain genetic risks that may affect their offspring .
It is better to let the other party know the facts before the baby is born rather than after a certain type of genetic disease is found .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
Secondly , genetic diseases have a close relationship with the genes they are born with as well as their daily habits .
For example , if a carrier is told that they have a risk of developing diabetes .
In this case , the carrier can eat fewer candies and chocolates to prevent taking in too much sugar , and at the same time , if the carrier shares this information with their relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future due to related genes and they can do the same exercise to take in less sugar to prevent the disease .
Otherwise , if the other parties were unaware , they may end up having diabetes in the future without any prevention .
In conclusion , we could tell that the benefits of informing genetic risk carriers ' relatives outweigh the costs .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to the relatives , in order to let them know and prevent potential disease through daily exercise .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large number of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons .
Genetic disorders may or may not be hereditary diseases and it is sometimes hard to find out if one has these kinds of diseases .
It is a long-standing discussion as to whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that their disease is caused by a gene .
From the legal aspect , the answer is no , but from the ethical aspect , the answer should be yes .
We ca n't make a law to force a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell their relatives about their genetic problem .
It is immoral and impractical .
Firstly , someone 's type of disease is their own private matter .
Privacy protection belongs to one 's human rights .
If a law requires someone to divulge their privacy , especially when they are not willing to do so .
It is against their human rights and it is contrary to the spirit of the law .
The law 's spirit also includes fairness .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorders and other disorders ?
It is unfair to release a law that only pertains to the genetic disorder .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law .
A good law should be clear and easy to execute .
However , there are many problems against the execution of asking a carrier to tell their relatives the cause of their disease .
Firstly , what is the range of the relevants ?
For example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives , such as parents and siblings , or does he also need to tell relatives such as his grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's nephew ?
If you only say you need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of the law .
Other relatives may have the same potential to have such a disease .
How can a law made by the government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potential disease ?
However , from an ethical point of view .
The carrier themselves should have a feeling of responsibility to tell their relatives about their genetic disorder .
By doing this , they may be able to save the lives of their relatives .
It is because a carrier with bad genes may not necessarily have those genetic diseases , if they can lead a corresponding healthy lifestyle before the age at which the gene 's function becomes stronger .
A typical example is genetically caused hypertension .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make it harder for the carrier to digest the fat and salt in the blood , which can cause hypertension .
People usually get this type of hypertension after they become adults .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may make them more likely to get hypertension .
They can build a daily habit of eating less salt and fat and thus avoid hypertension .
In a nutshell , our society ca n't force genetic problem carriers to tell their disease to their relatives but they should be willing to tell their relatives about their genetic problem .
By doing so , fewer of their loved ones will suffer from the genetic problem .
In the age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible .
Genetic testing is made possible and available for one 's decision to undergo it .
It is able to detect illnesses or diseases , and even a child 's parentage .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a person carrying a known genetic risk to inform their relatives .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk were to be shared within the family or relatives , there might be chances for them to have it in their blood , which they can take necessary precautions to prevent .
But if it is a terminal disease such as a genetic disease , most of the relatives will be disheartened upon receiving the knowledge of it .
Therefore , some carriers will have the opinion of keeping it a secret .
This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell their relatives or not .
Some said that the genetic risk found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered personal information which should be kept confidential .
Most patients will be depressed after realizing their condition .
If one has a genetic disease after the test , he or she might not wish to inform the relatives as he might end up disheartening his extended family .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring any pessimism into their family .
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden to anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some see it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
On the other hand , others may think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of having the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to take measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases , given in the context of current medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is detected in the early stage .
Hence , with the knowledge of having genetic risk , the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might enable them to realize it at an earlier stage .
In conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the relatives of the risk of getting the same genetic disease .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the right to know their family 's inherited medical conditions .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are unaware of it and will continue living happily .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having a genetic risk of the disease will just add to their misery , as there is nothing that they can do about it .
All in all , it depends on the individual and the nature of the disease , but they should be obligated to inform relatives if there are possibilities of curing or preventing it .
Genetic testing is a personal decision , with the knowledge that there is a possibility that one could be a carrier or not .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even if there is no risk at all .
Early preparation for examinations is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be a choice given with regards to informing their relatives .
There should not be forced or obligated to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision-making .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child , then the decision of informing the relative should most likely be made with the consideration of the patient 's parents or legal guardian .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile , or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorders due to their young age .
Furthermore , the act of informing others without the consent of their parents or the patients themselves could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Therefore , much thought needs to be put on the immediate family , as it could cause a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members themselves .
Some families may feel hurt with regards to their family pride or reputation , upon having knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives , since it is a genetic disorder .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and other family members within the same family tree .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic diseases is vital , as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorders .
Additionally , this known information will help their relatives make informed decisions and similarly undergo genetic testing to find out the outcome .
Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial for their emotional well-being .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is made known to them .
Having support from relatives is vital , as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that they are not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost , as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards to the future prospect of the genetic disorder , which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorders will be dependent on the situation and background of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others .
A person with a disorder , regardless of whether it is a mental or physical disorder , is always easily noticed by their family .
When it comes to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore .
Genetic disorders are inherited generation by generation , but not all of the offspring show the relevant symptoms .
Sometimes a family at risk of a potential genetic disorder may not be able to detect the potential harm within their bodies as none of their members show any observable disorder symptoms .
As a result , if one of the members feels uncomfortable or unusual , they should be aware of whether any disorder in their body is a genetic risk or not .
Afterwards , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is to reveal the problem to their relatives or not .
If the disorder symptoms are reflected by a child , the parents will be informed by the medical team for sure , then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies ' condition .
On the contrary , if the carrier is an adult who has their own choice to choose whether to inform their relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves their family more than themselves , there is no doubt that they will tell their family about the issue .
That is true and , of course , it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
Think of it another way , if a child in the family knows that they are at risk of becoming a genetic risk carrier , and the risk could be inherited by their child in the future , their whole life will be in a dilemma .
And of course , they will think of not having any children after getting married , and the same thought applies to the cousins as well .
As a result , the family generation stops at the moment the adult carrier announces his issue .
In China , the older generation with a traditional culture background will always think of having more children and grandchildren to make the family livelier and stronger .
The reason behind is that after WWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encouraged the people to give birth more often .
During that period , if one of the family members exhibits genetic disorder symptoms , they will certainly find themselves in an ethical dilemma .
The medical treatment technology at that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
He has to choose between protecting his family or making his family more prosperous with a potential generic risk .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo genetic disorder testing and let the truth remain undiscovered forever .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by others because they will not understand the position and duty of the caregiver in the family .
In conclusion , people should think carefully about the consequences of telling their relatives about their genetic disorder issues .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but it is also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family .
Regardless , if the disorder is rarely fatal , or it does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
In my opinion , the carrier should inform their relatives about it .
One of the reasons is because as a carrier , they need mental support to go through this situation .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on their own .
By telling his or her family , other than providing support , they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem she is facing right now .
Other than that , I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support for the career .
Furthermore , since it is a genetic problem , it will be better for the carrier to inform their family as other family members might experience the same thing .
By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem , they could have a full check-up and even prevent it from happening to themselves .
I find that it is important to inform , especially if it is contagious , so the carrier can prevent the disease from spreading to society .
For every action there are always pros and cons .
I believe that some of the carriers will choose not to reveal their disease to their family members as they do not want to make them worry and feel uncomfortable , or even feel ostracized .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lot of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden to her family .
I could understand the feelings of the caregiver .
She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in the family .
However , we will never know whether these negative effects will happen when the carrier decides to tell his or her family of their condition .
In conclusion , personally I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform their family members about the issue .
The carrier should be honest with his or her feelings and I find that it is the right of the family members to know what is going on in their lives .
If anything wrong happened to the carrier 's life , not informing the family members could cause a huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members , since there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own .
In the end , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from one 's family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .
Indeed , there are many cancer patients who were given a second chance to live as a normal person due to their strong emotional support from their loved ones .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our minds healthy and strong , we can fight any disease when it comes to us when we are fragile and weak .
As technology has been advancing , it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the actual use of the technology .
Genetic testing has been made possible — it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness ; however , it could also make the situation worse by revealing who the carrier is in the family .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their relatives and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I believe that they have the right not to know .
First , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory .
Of course , some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier ; however , the carrier , before the testing , can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts .
If he chooses to live with the uncertainty that the gene holds and is willing to accept it , he could do that , and it has been something that is ' normal ' to everyone in the past as genetic testing was not possible .
It could be better for them this way .
Some people might say that it is a form of prevention of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real life .
I personally think this is the right purpose of going through the genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid does not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
However , I believe that the carrier has the right not to disclose any information but has responsibility to take action to prevent any ethical dilemma .
If the result turned out to be something that the carrier can not accept , then it would have been better not to know the truth .
I believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the true facts .
After realizing that they are the carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in a family due to the fact and creates more unhappiness in the family .
Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives , but he has no obligation to tell still .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and take an appropriate action based on the results .
The emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilt can be more than expected and could be a burden on the mind for the rest of their life .
On the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the disability .
I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is , without having emotional stress .
Debates have been around for years as to whether a carrier for a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform their relatives .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be disclosed to others , especially close family or relatives , is a topic worth discussing .
This is an issue that needs to be addressed , as there is a family-related ethical dilemma involved .
In this essay , few arguments will be pointed out in support of the view that carriers of known genetic risks should tell their relatives .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , welcoming us to this new world .
We were crying hard but we were not alone , it 's our family and relatives who raised us .
Hence , they should be the people we should be grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy with .
However , in the case of any health issue or serious disorder , it may seem pointless to share , but this involves more than just sharing bad news .
One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it is also one 's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives .
As the case of health issues is related to genetic risk , with emphasis on " genetics " which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation .
Therefore , I would agree that it is obligated for a carrier of known genetic risk to tell their relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be raised up in the future .
Though one may argue that it is still up to the individual to disclose such health issues or to bear them within themselves , it is certainly helpful to share with close relatives for proper discussions of solutions .
By doing so , one will feel less stressed in facing such risk of disorder .
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more care towards the carrier of a known genetic risk .
By informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle against such disorder risks .
On top of that , as the genetic risk may be passed down to the next generation , it will involve more than just one family .
Therefore , I would agree to the obligation of informing the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and plan for childbirth .
This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
There are more intangible advantages that could support the stance of informing the relatives once the results are known after the test is conducted .
In conclusion , in order to avoid family-related ethical dilemmas , it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform their relatives .
The benefits of doing so are able to outweigh its disadvantages .
More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing at such a junction of whether or not he / she should inform the relatives .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
This is the common law in society .
However , it leads to a new problem : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
This issue has been discussed for a long time .
However , there is still a diversity of points of view among the people .
Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue of " should or should not " .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentence below : " I will be anxious about my family when they told me that they were a carrier of a known genetic risk . "
Frequently , the intention of the carriers is not to tell their families and to continue their own lives without the anxiety of their families .
It is obvious that it is better for one person to be worried than for many to be worried .
However , many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges on their own .
With the families ' support , there must be more energy to fight against the demon .
Demons are not easily defeated and it requires a lot of energy and psychological support .
Families give you the courage and support which you can not retrieve by yourself .
That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Furthermore , the risks posed by known genetic disorders are so serious that they can not be described .
The seriousness can be greater than our imagination .
Living on the bed for the rest of one 's life , and even dying immediately , these are consequences that we can not imagine .
Families are the dearest in our life .
Without their concern and support , we would have been hard-pressed to stay until this time .
They play an important role in our life which can not be substituted .
A known genetic risk can also critically affect our next generation .
Therefore , it is our responsibility to inform the relatives to prevent undesired consequences .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not inform the carrier 's family without the carrier 's agreement .
It is the ethical duty of hospital staff to keep the secret of any patients .
We can not blame them for being liable to the undesired consequences .
However , hospitals can provide a counselor to advise the carrier about the actions that can be taken .
Therefore , this kind of circumstance will not happen again .
It is a method that benefits both parties , creating a win-win situation .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell their relatives about the known genetic risk .
However , there may be some special cases that are hard to define .
Thus , advice from hospitals plays an important role for this .
The individual is responsible for balancing their own interests and the benefits of family and society .
It is a hard decision to make , but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for the career and families in the future .
With the risk of being genetically disordered , many individuals have made the decision to undergo genetic testing .
Given that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed as a genetic risk carrier faces an ethical problem : they should warn their relatives about the risk of being the same genetic risk carrier .
Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is identified .
In my view , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their relatives , with the following reasons supporting it .
First of all , from the perspective of human rights , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privilege for carriers .
They may not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it a secret and not let others know about it .
This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated against or sympathized with by others , which are not positive factors brought to their lives .
Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier .
When people want to check whether they are at genetic risk , they can consult a doctor .
If they do n't want to think too much about it and view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility .
However , if a diagnosed carrier is obligated to tell their relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers .
This obeys their own will as in they have to accept the truth which may make their subsequent life miserable .
Many people may argue that setting the obligation may help more people , who are the relatives of the carriers , save their lives with a larger opportunity due to early diagnosis .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors including psychological influence and social influence are taken into consideration .
If one such relative is told that they may have a higher risk of getting sick , they may be scared of the unknown ; their life partners , spouse , and colleagues may choose to leave ; and many other situations may occur which could ruin their life .
On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have the right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
This should be accepted from the point of human rights , freedom of acceptance of relatives , as well as many other social reasons .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
For a carrier of a genetic disorder to know that they are carriers , it causes more dilemma than getting the disorder .
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell their relatives .
There are four reasons why people do n't have to be shy and share their problems regarding genetic disorders .
Firstly , the carrier and their family can take precautions , physically by actions to reduce the chance of its being inherited to offspring , and mentally , if the action fails to prevent it from being inherited .
Many syndromes such as Down Syndrome and Tay-Sachs Syndrome can be prevented if the mother undergoes proper medication and does not consume harmful goods during the pregnancy period .
This information may not be known by the mother if she does n't tell her relatives about her condition .
The more people ( relatives ) who know about her problem , the more information channels are provided .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome , then the family has to accept this fact and do whatever they can to bring a good environment for their children 's growth .
This is not the parent 's fault because there is still a chance of the gene being inherited .
So , they also have to prepare mentally .
Secondly , genetic diseases cost a lot for treatment and medication .
Albinism is one of the examples .
People with albinism have sensitive skin and it needs regular treatment .
Unlike people with high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism are prone to sunburn and other skin diseases .
If they do n't treat their bodies well , such as by wearing sunglasses or sunscreen outdoors , they are likely to have skin problems that may even lead to cancer .
Once you suffer from cancer , the medication costs are very expensive .
To prevent a bigger problem from happening , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
If the carrier does n't tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
One of the diseases is sickle cell anemia .
Usually , people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene , and this may lead to circulatory problems such as blood clotting .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives , they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do n't need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
Fourthly , it is important for the parents to give mental support to their children with genetic disorders .
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise .
People and friends often mock your conditions .
A strong mental condition and conviction must be built from within and from the closest ones .
If not their family , who else is willing to do that ?
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepared their minds first by disclosing the information of the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder .
In this modern world , technologies have improved a lot compared to the last century .
Particularly , in the medical field , there has been a great improvement in many treatments for many formerly incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder .
The medical authorities claimed that only individuals at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma arises .
The question is whether someone carrying a known genetic risk should tell their relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell their relatives about this .
This is because their relatives have the right to know about this .
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives ; that is , if one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder , it means that other family members have almost the same risk of having it , so this problem should be taken seriously by the family .
Every family member has their own right to know what is going on with them .
If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this explain their plight ?
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling James about this .
Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent , he should know what is likely to be going on for him .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risks of having this disorder .
The next point is that informing relatives can raise their awareness of having the same genetic disorder , thus preventing certain genetic disorders from affecting them .
Genetic disorders are innate , but great improvements in medical treatment make it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves .
Furthermore , doctors usually quote the statement , " Prevention is better than cure " ; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder from happening has far more advantages than curing it .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person , and therefore , this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
People who are aware of having such disorders can prevent them from happening by adapting to a healthy lifestyle , including having a balanced diet and exercising for at least 30 minutes every day .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their relatives .
This is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder from happening .
Together with the advancement of technology over the past decades , medical advancement has increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly upgrading . Empowering doctors with advance medical knowledge , doctors are able to diagnose and undergo genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their lives . However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives becomes a challenging issue to both patient and doctor . In my opinion , I feel strongly compelled to support the obligation to inform patient relatives .
As it is a genetic risk , the patient 's next-of-kin might have a high chance of carrying the risk , hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur . For example , if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately , you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child , hence by letting your family members be aware of the situation , it would lessen family stresses and suffering by not forcing you to settle down and have children . However , social ethics issues such as discrimination and privacy are the biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforcing patients or doctors to disclose information to patients ' relatives . It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles . Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States , there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives ; it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members . Early disclosure to family members brings a positive reaction and prevention , as in the case of Angelina Jolie , she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent . I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she did not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
However , there are still people against the decision of revealing private information . As in the case of Alzheimer patients , it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information . However , research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who , how and to whom Alzheimer 's disease should be disclosed to minimize potential negative impacts to family members ( DementiaToday , 2012 ) . There are associations that provide help to Alzheimer patients , such as the Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association , 1980 ) . Although there are still thousands of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all the help and support they need from everyone , having immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult times .
In conclusion , the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors concerning the extent to which they should reveal genetic diseases to relatives , and in which situations it should be left to the patient 's decision . In addition , the state could also encourage the creation of assistance schemes to provide necessary aid to needy patients , to encourage them to divulge the information for the benefit of themselves and their family members . Although it may face challenges from social ethics issues , in the long term , with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government , more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measures to protect their own health and that of their loved ones .
Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has progressed further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancements .
Not long ago , the Human Genome Project sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) has been started .
In comparison , in the field of genetic testing , which enables people to be aware of the risk of possible genetic disorders , as the technology is already very mature , an even more popular topic arises .
While most people agree that each individual has their own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different stances on whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the results with their relatives .
In my opinion , patients who are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be responsible for the lives of other people .
It is a duty to the whole society .
Taking H1N1 as an example , all people in Singapore , including students at school , travelers at Changi Airport , workers in offices , and passengers on the street are forced by law to take their temperature and report the results to the relevant government authority in charge .
For those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger ?
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other with no doubts .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together .
Hence , it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder both as a social responsibility and a favor to preserve the family line .
Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support .
Without the support of loved ones , a patient 's life is no better than death .
Family members , as the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorders .
A study from New York University in 2010 showed that patients with family members around generally recovered 2-4 days faster than those taken care of by professional nurses .
Even for those patients with terminal diseases , their survival duration is 30 % longer due to family support .
Some people may say that telling the truth may raise some unnecessary doubts and panic which will endanger family harmony .
While every family needs to go through this or that kind of troublesome situation , the more trouble a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as a greater amount of trust , love , and understanding .
Hence , for a family in which every member truly believes in and loves each other , all these troubles are just testimonies to make them stronger .
Just as the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson say , what does n't kill you makes you stronger .
Being in an Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell their relatives about their disease .
The courage to take the genetic testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental , while actually it is just a risk and not a confirmed case .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information .
Nevertheless , while I feel that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest the person at least share the information with their potential partner ( husband or wife ) since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children .
Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will most likely judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or ' weird ' .
This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble Boy disease , autism , or Down syndrome .
In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic disorder .
While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
In this particular case , we are discussing whether a person should tell his relatives about him having a risk of a particular genetic disease .
It is normal for people to demand fair and similar treatment as others , and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge or treat them differently . Many people love to hear what they want to hear , so they may ignore the word ' risk ' and assume the person has suffered from the disease .
To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judgmental and act differently .
Especially when it is just a risk , the option is really his since he is not an actual sufferer .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risks since some of them may be affected . While I do think that this view has a point , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a consideration .
Maybe we can trust our immediate family members , but can we really trust all the other relatives ?
Furthermore , since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is up to the person 's call to tell the relatives about it .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell their future partner about the potential risk since their genetic risk may affect their children later .
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
There may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers , and therefore they should not have any children since their child may not be able to survive even after they are born .
Or in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters , therefore although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to tell it to their potential partner .
In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives regarding his genetic risk , the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has full rights over it .
He may have different considerations other than worrying about judgement from others , or making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell it to his relatives , and no matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it and we have no right in saying that he must tell his relatives about it .
We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge someone 's death .
With the advancement of technology , a new life with genetic risks can be detected .
Genetics refers to the chances of inheriting a disorder or disease .
Therefore , an entirely new dilemma is born : Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell their relatives ?
This essay will discuss the reasons why relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have genetic risks .
One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable of raising a child with a genetic risk .
The child with genetic risk may not have the ability to work , build up their family with others , and most of the time they are not accepted by the majority .
They may not be able to enjoy the things that normal people can enjoy .
This competitive world is cruel to those who are not able to survive .
Parents and relatives have to work longer and endlessly than expected to foster their child if he / she is not able to foster himself / herself .
The situation may become worse if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy burden named medication fees .
Not only the child , but the entire family will suffer .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that is not able to work and may suffer pain throughout their life .
Another reason why parents should be aware if their baby is a carrier of genetic risk is for the nation 's good .
There are always newspaper reports that a newborn baby has been abandoned at a hospital after they realized the baby has diseases that need a huge amount of money to secure .
For countries like Singapore , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disabled , such as providing medical subsidies and building special schools to educate them .
By not increasing the number of disabled people in a nation , the government is able to concentrate on developing in other ways , such as military and education .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
Moreover , in the world we are living in today , many miscarriages are conducted in hospitals every day .
It is easier for people to accept it morally .
Therefore , I believe the parents have the right to know the health of their child .
Many people may support the theory that everyone has the right to enjoy the world , especially people of faith .
However , the problem is , will people really enjoy their life if they have to stay in the hospital every day and with all the needles and endless pain ?
Parents know what is best for their children , so they will make the right decision after they have been informed .
Also , human beings should improve the medical field in order to prevent tragedies from happening .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their relatives .
Genetic testing is a personal choice .
One should have full control of their information and it is their right to decide whether or not to disclose it to someone else .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple is going to have a baby , they are going to run a few tests to see if they could have any genetic diseases .
The results are disclosed to husbands and wives .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
The most obvious reason for those arguing for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
Additionally , informing them of the results can significantly reduce the cost of multiple tests .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of contracting this disease .
If a person has a disease C that might be a result of gene A.
He ran a test and knew that he had the gene AA .
This means that both of his parents have gene A and they are both at a high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and knows that he has the gene A.
This means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved .
His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can somehow be prevented , to stop this disease from claiming their lives .
However , this can also be achieved through personal choice .
One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk .
Most people care about their relatives ; if there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful .
One might also choose to hint or encourage certain relatives to take a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that come with disclosing their genetic results .
There are possible negative consequences that people might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relatives .
If a person is obligated to tell their relatives , they might be discriminated by those who do not carry this gene .
They might even be advised not to get married or have children .
For example , if an unmarried person has the genotype Aa and aa is sufficient for a very serious disease .
After he took the test and was obligated to tell his relatives , everyone knew that he was a carrier .
So all the married couples should go and run a test to know they are not carriers . They might subconsciously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well .
Third , it is hard to define relatives .
If a gene runs in the family , and one of the family members tests positive , who do they need to tell ?
If that is a big family , is he obliged to tell everyone ?
Spouses usually have very close relationships ; if Person A tells his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needs to run a test because his cousin has this disease .
However , wife D is not even at risk of having this disease .
Then Wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theater .
In less than a week , half of the town knows that person A has a risk gene , and his family might be a genetically risky family .
Then nobody wants to marry A , or their relatives .
This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of their information , especially when the party that they are obliged to disclose their information to is a potentially large group ( relatives ) .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their relatives .
Carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their relatives .
Nowadays , people not only pursue the comfort of their own lives , but also a better development of their future generations .
Since modern society 's technology has been so advanced , it has become possible for people to make decisions to take genetic tests to ascertain if they carry genetic risks that can affect their next generation .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is whether people are responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
In my opinion , the responsibility of informing family and relatives is quite obvious .
And there are two basic reasons .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your own wellness and the health of your relatives , and the second is being responsible for future generations .
The awareness of your relatives and family about your genetic risk is good for your self-wellness and the health of your relatives .
Because if you are carrying that genetic risk , then there is a great possibility that your relatives , such as parents or siblings , are carrying the same genetic risk as well .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger .
If you have n't undergone the genetic testing , it 's just a guess and fate for what will happen to both of you and your relatives .
However , if you have undergone testing and are aware that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert and avoid getting the disease .
For those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital for regular check-ups .
Therefore , telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent getting the disease is your responsibility .
Furthermore , you are also being responsible for your future generations by informing them of the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
As a parent , you are responsible for your future generations , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on from generation to generation and are aware of it .
However , if you are honest with your wife and family , you give them the chance to choose whether to have a child or not .
And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering genes is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
This is the responsibility of being a parent .
And in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing that genetic testing in the first place .
As a conclusion , once you have undergone genetic testing and are aware of carrying certain genetic risks , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and future generations by telling your relatives and family the truth .
To tell or not to tell
Consider the case where we decide to undergo genetic testing and know the results .
We found that we are actually the genetic risk carriers .
Then it becomes troublesome to decide whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well .
There are really a lot of things we need to consider .
Every choice we have made may have a huge impact on their whole lives .
As a result , what should we do ?
Should we tell them or keep this secret until we die ?
Many people feel that we should inform our relatives since we really care about their health status .
For example , diabetes is a kind of genetic disorder .
Once we found we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits , such as eating less sugar-containing food and keeping a good mood .
And it is important for those young people .
The earlier we tell them , the better habits they will develop and the better they will be for the rest of their lives .
What 's more , they may undergo genetic testing as well to see whether they are carrying it or not , which is also better for them .
However , some people may argue why we want to interfere with their lives ?
Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news , especially if they know that they or their descendants may have an incurable , severe disease , such as a blood disease .
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes and tells you that there may be some possibilities that you may encounter a disease in the future . What kind of feeling are you going to have ?
It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day .
We become so anxious that we can not focus on everything .
At the same time , there is also a chance that the genetic test results are not correct , which means they are wasting their lives worrying about this thing , so in reality we are bringing trouble to them .
Personally , I feel that we should still take our responsibility to inform them about the situation .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try to make it a positive experience .
We can not let it go .
We should know that although we may influence their lives , we can still let them make correct choices in the future .
It is only after we tell them that they will start paying attention to their health .
They will consider whether to give birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby carrying this genetic risk as well .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
Maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should remember that they are our loved ones ; we need to tell them and help them .
A genetic risk carrier should be obligated to tell .
Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of some potential disease .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be open to their relatives has caused social extensive controversy .
Some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell their relatives about their actual situation .
This essay will illustrate two aspects .
First of all , it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible diseases that they may also have .
As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass the genetics to their family members .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying a risky gene , other members of his or her family may also have the risk of disease .
Some diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble and save much time for proper treatment .
Sometimes lives may even be saved if they are told early and receive timely treatment .
So for the consideration of the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
Secondly , it can avoid genetic diseases passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies .
They should let their spouse know about their situation before marriage .
They need to ask a doctor for advice before they plan to have a baby .
Some genetic genes will be passed on only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to their spouse , another life may risk inheriting the genetic disease .
I noticed a real story in the newspaper years ago .
A couple in China has a five-year-old son .
Their son unfortunately fell ill and was diagnosed with a kind of genetic disease which is very serious .
They were told that the wife 's family was carrying the polygenic disorder and it can only be passed to boys rather than girls .
Therefore their son inherited the genetic disease .
However , the wife had already known about the polygenic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband .
The son died after a year of treatment and the couple got divorced afterward .
If the wife had not hidden the truth and asked for a doctor 's advice before they had a baby , the tragedy would not have happened .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to inform their relatives .
On the one hand , it can tell members of the carrier 's family about the possible diseases they may have and can provide timely treatment if possible .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do genetic testing .
We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face disorder problems .
However , I thought that genetic information is a person 's personal privacy which should be protected by the law .
Therefore , I thought a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their family or relatives .
There are three reasons as follows .
First , the information concerning genetics is something personally , which is also a privacy like people 's bank card key .
Other people should not be told without the person 's permission , even though they are their family or relatives .
The government should set laws to protect this kind of privacy .
Once people 's genetic information is disclosed to others .
They may know the person 's potential disabling disease or other bad things naturally .
They may set a bias on this person or even abandon him or her .
People do not have the ability to choose their genes , they should not be thought of badly because of bad genes .
So I think whatever the genetics are or whether the genes match with their parents , it should not be told to anyone , even their family or relatives .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family and even break the relationship between children and adults .
Once their family or relatives know that the person does not have a relationship with them .
However happy they were before , there would be some barriers that appear which would truly destroy the family gradually .
The relationship between parents and their children should not be tested only genetically ; it is something much deeper and tighter .
The parents give knowledge and love to the children , and they feel happy with the company of the children .
The children rely on their parents to live .
When they grow up , they take care of their old parents and thank them for their dedication .
The relationship between parents and children is one of love and dedication .
Everyone does not want to see the scene of a broken family due to a known genetic risk .
Therefore , I think a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their family or relatives without their permission .
Finally , the technology of testing genes is not very mature now .
There also exists a probability of incorrect testing .
If the wrong diagnosis was not made by the doctor , the family and the children may be saddled with a struggle for their entire lives .
Therefore , I think a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their family or relatives .
Therefore , considering people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their family or relatives without the person 's permission .
A Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell Their Relatives .
More and more illnesses are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of medical technology .
People will know whether they carry a disease in their genes after they have had the genetic test .
If there are no problems , that will be wonderful .
However , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any genetic diseases .
Therefore , once people find they have carried the disease genes , they should be responsible for telling their relatives , at least their family members .
It may be awkward and embarrassing for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
But they are all from one family and have the same forefather , then of course they have the same genes in some part .
Therefore there is nothing to be shy of or be afraid of .
If the person tells their relatives that they carry a disease gene , their relatives can go to the hospital to check whether they also have the disease gene .
Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease from occurring .
Also , they can prevent the disease from being passed down to their offspring .
If the relatives carry that gene for the disease , they can share their experience with him or her and give some help . They will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
If they do not get married , they must tell their partner that they carry a diseased gene .
Then , they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctors .
Otherwise , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby and it may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
I watched a story on TV .
A couple did not have a child after their marriage for a long time ; their parents were anxious about that and asked them to go to the hospital to check what the problem was .
After coming back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene , so that they could not have a baby in their lifetime .
The woman did not know the test results , but she overheard the conversation and decided to divorce her husband .
After getting the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it wrote that the woman carried the disease gene instead of the man .
At that time , the woman knew how much her husband loved her , but she ruined her happiness .
Tears showed nothing .
People can not avoid carrying the disease genes , which they are born with .
However , they can avoid the disease genes being inherited by their children .
By telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease gene , their family members can bond closely , and many risks and conflicts can be avoided .
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect individuals at risk for a disorder .
However , there arises a family-related ethical dilemma if it is right to tell a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the right to know the result .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , and the consequences will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
Then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and make emotional preparations .
Taking Angelina Jolie for example , she is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing on the development of her breast cancer risk .
Everything is not that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
In some cases , a carrier can cause tension within a family because the result is also related to the others ' risk somehow .
However , I believe it is a usual reaction to this situation .
Additionally , while it is possible in some cases that they and their family may experience specific discrimination in employment and social life , people can face more dramatic tragedies such as sickness or death if they can not even survive this harsh situation .
Life is hard , but people can not blame it on being unfair .
It is just because you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially if the situations of other relatives become worse ; you should feel guilty and depressed .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever but when it is revealed , the more shocking and upsetting it will be .
As a result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives that the genetic testing results be disclosed .
Last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the results to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy of each other as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
That plays an important role in allowing relatives to overcome the discrimination of society and anxiety about the risks .
To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing results for the good of their health .
It can be very difficult for them , but necessary for the carriers and their families .
In addition , emotional preparation and the ways you explain your genetic condition are also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives and , if necessary , guide them if they wish to conduct a similar genetic testing .
The Impact of Social Media
Social media has been playing a vital role in our lives today .
It is almost impossible for us to stay away from it .
I started getting involved with Facebook one year ago when I just arrived in Singapore .
And now I have over 500 friends on Facebook and bury myself with hundreds of messages every day .
We know each other 's status , changes , and so on through social media .
For example , if we change our contact numbers , we will no longer send SMS to each individual .
Instead , we will post a message and tag our friends to inform about these changes .
And if you are n't on it , you will just get lost .
In certain aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience .
It is becoming even more convenient than talking through the phone since it is free .
We discussed everything we liked and we had more personal space . Our friends also had more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
And also , we get a chance to talk to public figures like popular stars and know their life better .
In China , a lot of government organizations have opened blogs to communicate with people , such as firefighters , police stations , and so on .
Social media allows them to explain or inform people what is going on .
And actually lots of rescue jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people who get lost and so on .
With more convenient and humane communications , the relationship between the government and people has greatly improved .
What 's more , various cultures can be shown to us through social media .
We can learn more news and cultures through social media .
From this perspective , social media has shortened our distance .
However , we get less chance and less importance to talk face-to-face since social media is so convenient , advanced , and interesting .
Even when we gather together , more people find themselves with fewer topics to talk about than before and choose to dive into their social media again .
When we are far away , social media makes it seem like we are in front of each other ; sometimes when we are side by side , we seem to be further apart than when we are far away .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationships less stable , secure , and reliable than before .
Additionally , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travel experiences .
To some extent , this makes our life more luxurious and bewildering .
For myself , I am longing to some places after I saw those beautiful pictures taken by my friends .
Sometimes I even ca n't sleep well because of excitement .
Social media makes our lives so fast-paced and leaves us less time to think about our lives .
Social media is becoming more important and we need to think more to make it serve us better .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skills , require practice .
Besides that , these skills require time to develop and be adapted .
The burgeoning of social media definitely has its stint ; but amongst all good things , it is better to have them in moderation .
Convenience and efficiency are two very important uses of social media .
While millions of users are connected at any one time , any information can be readily available for their perusal .
This improves connectivity between the users .
For example , one is able to send notifications and other information that used to be in hardcopy previously , over the web and the process takes seconds .
The recipient will then receive the information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network .
This convenience can be perceived as almost real-time .
Next , communication is also greatly improved .
In the past , vast communication was done through one of the many such methods as telegram , snail mail , and poor-quality voice calls .
With the welcome of applications such as Skype and Facetime , any individual can phase out most of the old-fashioned communication methods .
Aside from hearing the voice , a webcam could also be affixed to emulate a " real " interaction with expressions and gestures .
Communication would have taken a different turn without the easily available social media .
However , it is a good practice not to intensively use social media all the time .
Intimate interaction is greatly lacking in social media interactions , particularly touch .
Meeting and interacting for talks allows one to be closer to the recipient .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utilizes the motor , thinking , and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate .
Unlike the use of social media , most interaction is done through thinking and typing .
As a result , one does not train the necessary parts of the skills required for proper interpersonal relationships .
It is also entirely incorrect to blame social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skills .
Howard Gardner studied the effect of multiple intelligences amongst people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skill on its own-some have it , some do not .
Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance with utilizing tests , and ranked .
Fundamentally , those who scored lower rankings for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when these skills are needed .
Though social media need not necessarily be bad , it must be used accordingly-for work , family , and friends .
The types of use must also be taken note of-informing , interacting , discussing , and others .
The distance of separation between the parties must also be looked at .
For people living far apart , intense use of social media is justified .
Those who live within the community should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of communication with each other .
At the same time , it improves interpersonal skills through dynamic practices between individuals and real-time presence .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting .
Recently , the rise of social media has helped people to have closer connections with each other . It is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared to face-to-face meetings .
In my opinion , social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face-to-face contact and thus negatively affect interpersonal skills .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chance of having face-to-face contacts among people .
First , social media networks have a large user base , which helps to link people from different parts of the world .
In the days before the social networks , people may not have had the chance to know others from different countries or those they had never met before .
The number of people they know may be limited only to the people they meet in daily life , such as classmates and working partners .
Therefore , social networks bring more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they have never known before , and this helps to develop interpersonal skills as well .
Secondly , although social networks take time for people to chat online rather than in person , they may still decide to meet each other face to face in their daily lives .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of communication .
For example , if social networks did not exist , business people would need to meet each other face to face and it would be time consuming , even for business that is not so important ; it still takes a lot of time for travel , which is a waste .
However , social networks help people to meet and chat much more easily ; they can even use video chat and create group chats to chat with multiple parties at the same time .
Nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interviews with their applicants as it saves time and cost .
The social network may also create some negative impacts for the people .
The largest negative impact is that due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on the internet every minute .
They take too much time using online social networks and thus do not have time to meet people in person in their daily lives .
It not only affects interpersonal skills but it is also bad for people 's health if they spend too much time on social media .
Secondly , social networks may leak certain personal information to the public as the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe . People may not be able to protect their privacy online effectively , and sometimes , some people may use others ' personal information to deceive .
In conclusion , although the online environment is unsafe , spending too much time on the internet may be potential negative factors of using online social networks .
It provides people with a more convenient contact environment and improves the frequency of meetings .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chatting .
Overall , there are more benefits than costs .
The world is increasingly becoming more interconnected by all kinds of social network websites such as Facebook and Twitter .
We can even know what a friend who is thousands of miles away is eating for lunch through these kinds of social media .
From some points of view , social media really has a lot of advantages by allowing us to communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently .
However , its disadvantages can not be ignored when you consider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cybercrime .
Social network sites provide us with many conveniences .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends over the phone , we can keep up with their latest news by scanning the webpage .
It can help us know more about each other .
It can bring people closer as well .
For example , if you find out one of your friends ' favorite singer is Justin Bieber through Facebook , you can give them Justin Bieber 's new album or concert ticket as a birthday gift .
It will be really sweet and you two will surely become closer .
In addition , social networking sites can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away .
I met some Canadian friends in Egypt .
Without Facebook , we may lose contact .
However , thanks to Facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they are doing recently as we live close to each other .
The disadvantages of social media networks are quite undeniable .
A research shows that people will unconsciously hide their real thoughts when they say or post something that will be exposed to the public .
It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personalities by reading things they put on social network media .
It will make them quite upset when they communicate in real life .
In addition , with all the “ nice ” people around on the social networking website , one may neglect the people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on Facebook .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk to each other but just look at their cellphones .
This kind of behavior is not good for people 's psychological health according to research .
Cyber communication is quite different from face-to-face communication , and people who rely too much on cyber communication will not get used to real-life communication .
In addition , cyber relationships can not always work in real life .
With no close relationships in real life but only close cyber friends , one is more likely to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others by our five senses .
With the willingness of people to be the best among others , social networking sites now become a place to show off .
Some people will post their expensive things or the overseas places of interest they have been to on the social network and get a sense of satisfaction by doing so .
It is a mental health issue and it may trigger people , especially teenagers , to become materialistic .
Last but not least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is convenient for criminals to make use of this information to commit a crime .
Above all , social networking sites are like a double-edged sword and people can only take advantage of it by avoiding its possible disadvantages , such as putting less personal information on their Facebook page .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication faster than ever before .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within contemporary society ; and people can communicate with each other , online or offline , on these social networking platforms .
They can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms , which can connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people , as they prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
This essay will discuss both the benefits and downsides of using social media in the contemporary society .
Nowadays , social media is able to disseminate information faster than any other media .
Approximately 50 % of people have learned about breaking news from social media .
This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than on reading newspapers .
Furthermore , with current technology , smartphones are able to access social media sites , making it easier for consumers to use .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated is reliable .
There might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb that had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
This had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this had resulted in the temporary closure of schools .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information at a relatively fast speed .
Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent the spread of these hoaxes .
However , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social media movement .
Social media can improve relationships and make new friends , provided there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
In the past , people used to write letters to their friends and it would take a relatively long time to send the letter .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to keep in touch conveniently .
Furthermore , it will be easier to make new friends who have similar interests or hobbies .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationships as well as make new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media .
In addition , there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties due to miscommunication .
But , if there is trust and mutual understanding on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationships and make new friends .
In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of .
All in all , social media is a product of rapid technological advancement and there are more to come in the future .
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly facilitated long distance communication and interaction due to their accessibility and convenience .
With a globalized and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the main platforms for social interaction .
With just a touch away from any media / electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with their friends without much hassle .
Thus , long distance relationships or friendships can be maintained and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of one 's statuses and feelings , and the ability to reply to these posts , human interaction was able to engage and expand with ease .
Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platforms .
Thus , socialization can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilization of such social media platforms . Meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience .
The society will adapt to such phenomena as physical interactions are transformed into cyber interactions .
With the frequent use and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socializes through the cyber realm will be more advanced and adapted to the highly connected world .
This will greatly help society to progress rapidly .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platforms to communicate is credibility .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
We can not be certain of the reliability or truth of some posts or information we receive through the Internet .
We may in fact be communicating with a hoax Facebook account of a cyber friend , which we assume to be real but is actually a fake account .
Photos and information retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit certain personal agendas .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated by the media .
Although emoticons can be used to show certain emotions , this differs from the real authentic emotions of your friends when you observe them through their body language and facial expressions .
The danger of such social media is the uncertainty of communication due to lack of physical interaction .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human interpersonal behavior since communication is made through social media instead of meet-ups .
This lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another , which can adversely shape one 's behavior .
The lack of exposure to real-life interaction with humans will not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction among its people .
Nowadays , people can even use their phones to read news and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world .
People use Twitter to follow the artists or celebrities they love and Facebook to see their friends ' recent activity .
Nevertheless , they can still use phones to make normal calls and send messages to contact .
Not only did the phone do the job for them , but also devices like personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many other devices which are able to connect to the internet .
It is obvious to see that the internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Several arguments have been made regarding social media , which actually has some inevitable disadvantages for people .
People can only access the internet with electronic devices .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or the internet .
Generally , people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phones or computers and their fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
As a result , they will lose eye contact and the ability to express their feelings to people near them , which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face communication .
This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays .
A family of four were having dinner in a restaurant without any chatting , as they were holding and looking at their display screens with one hand while the other hand was holding a fork .
A group of friends was having high tea in a café without chatting as well , because they did n't know what to talk about but were pressing on their phones ' screens .
The children nowadays do not know what neighborhood games are and who is staying beside them , all they know is pressing icons on the screens .
These are some concrete examples of how social media reduces face-to-face human contact .
When people get used to using social media to contact other people , what will happen is that their interpersonal communication skills will degrade and be lost eventually .
Firstly , they have lost the courage to meet strangers , not even the courage to talk .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people face-to-face and will not be trained in conversation skills .
As a result , social media helps them to do their jobs , but it indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
Social media does have some other advantages besides its general benefits to human beings .
First of all , people save money by using the internet to contact other people and read news .
A father may be able to call his daughter who is in another country via social media software instead of making an international call , which costs a lot for a normal salary family .
He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using a video call via the internet .
Secondly , people make friends all over the world and are able to easily update their friends on their recent activity .
A guy who is going to travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activities .
When one of his friends , who is not aware of this , has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to ascertain his whereabouts using social media .
These are the advantages that save time most of the time .
In conclusion , social media benefits people in several ways , but at the same time , it harms people .
People should avoid the misuse of social media and use it in the proper way .
With the aid of social media , people bond globally , information flows rapidly , and humans live happily .
All of us are living in a technologically advanced society .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect with other people ?
It started with the invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
In the past , we traveled by ship and now we can use airplanes to do so .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message as we needed to post our letter and now , we can use e-mail , which stands for electronic message , to send messages to our friends or even use our cellphone to send our messages .
From the example I mentioned earlier , we can see that the distance between us and our loved ones is getting further apart .
This is because of the ease of technology such as airplanes ; some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies , or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or career in life .
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the media that we need .
Nevertheless , everything in life has positive and negative effects .
This is applicable to these social media sites .
The next two paragraphs will be discussing the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even when we are away from them .
Social media sites such as Facebook have allowed us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
This approach helps the parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities their children have when they are overseas .
Social media is beneficial as it connects you and your loved ones , even when separated by distance .
It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family , but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from them .
As I mentioned in the beginning , there are also disadvantages of social media tools .
One of them is that it reduces the level of concentration , especially among the youngsters .
This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their Facebook page as their friends post something new every second .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse Facebook while attending lectures .
This means that the students are not concentrating when they are supposed to do so .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
This could then lead to stress as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility for their own life by making the right decisions .
There are advantages and disadvantages to using social media sites , however in this case striking a balance between social media and life is the most important thing to do .
Nowadays , the use of social media platforms is commonplace in our lives .
In an increasingly globalized world , such platforms even enhance and complicate the links between individuals in the world .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for companies or personal reasons .
However , it is also bringing about some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world , resulting in some negative impacts on individuals ' daily lives and thus becoming a large problem in societies as a whole .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decreased .
As people feel more confident online , where they do not have to face people in real life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online .
This results in a lack of interpersonal skills in individuals , especially young students , as they always have the option to turn their back to real-life and go online .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but to face things in real life .
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their sense of self-identity in real life and may not know how to interact with people in real life .
Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy are not reflected as something positive to the users .
The reason why it is so addictive is that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends .
However , such sparks of sudden attention are extremely short-term and easily gone , thus not adding any value or meaning to the user 's life .
Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook , and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
But seriously , most people only post the happiest moments in their lives .
Social media definitely has some strong benefits that make users stay connected among people .
Indeed , I use Facebook myself just because of the friends I want to keep in contact with .
However , the friendship in such virtual worlds is so superficial and not so relevant to real life .
Also , as numerous profit-driven companies realize the huge human traffic on such social media sites , they make it a pond to fish for customers by uploading many advertisements .
Furthermore , this also possibly triggers privacy issues as Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to the information of the users .
As this happens , users are more and more prone to any possible frauds .
Social media sites are at their peak at the moment ; however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better people in real life , they will not be as indulged in them as they are now .
The users will soon realize that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach out to their friends no matter what .
We may think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but are we really getting connected or are we falling apart ?
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter were born with the intention of connecting people from around the world .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people , even the older generation , will have at least one social media platform like Facebook .
The parents are now the " friends " of their kids , and they can now " follow " their kids more closely and in real time .
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently , to stay connected with their so-called friends .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced face-to-face human contact , it eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
First and foremost , I would like to share the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds in different settings .
We may meet only once , but we exchanged our contact numbers as well as Facebook accounts in order to keep in touch .
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media such as Facebook is a great way for friends from different fields or even from different parts of the world to stay connected .
Within clicks , we could check our friend 's profile and read on for their updates .
On the other hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall , and our friends could read up on the newsfeed .
This allows friends who may not have time to meet up to still remain connected in some way .
Not only that , new friends can be easily met through such online platforms .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
Nonetheless , what seems to connect us can be the cause that drives us apart .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is that there is a reduction in face-to-face contact .
This subsequently leads to poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
For example , we tend to send birthday wishes when Facebook prompts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday .
We used to send greeting cards during festive seasons like Chinese New Year , and we felt so good writing one and of course receiving one with stamps on it .
Gone are the days , and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friendship needs to be redefined .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
The users of every social media site need to strike a balance between the real world and the virtual one .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms but be careful of its impacts on our actual lives .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings , but social media sites are tools to enhance them .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in society .
I believe 80 percent of people play social media sites .
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world .
It consists of functions of connecting , sharing , interacting , and advertising .
However , there are also some disadvantages that occur due to the use of social media in society .
Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily lives .
First , with the function of social media sites that connect people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families , or even strangers without any time and place constraints .
Through social media sites , we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand .
There are over a thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without traveling to the countries .
It saves a lot of money and time , and strengthens our relationship even though we stay in different places around the world .
Besides that , companies can also use the convenience of social media sites such as Facebook Chat or Skype to facilitate meetings with project partners from around the world .
Substantial costs are saved without the tiring travel from one point to another .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in other sectors which benefit the company more and boost up its profits .
However , there are always two sides to a story .
Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face-to-face connection between humans .
Since ancient times , humans have interacted with others face to face .
Without facial expressions , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers .
That is why facial expression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
In addition , " social media sites will affect writing skills " is the point of view in society .
Based on the statistics report , writing skills will be reduced more when more time is used on social media sites .
I believe most of us have experienced suddenly forgetting how to write a word that we should know .
The auto-correction software is so effective when using electronic devices that we do n't realize the importance of writing .
Writing is an essential skill for people who express their own feelings and opinions .
' Privacy ' is the word that has been popular in recent decades .
Humans have their own rights and privacy .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
However , there is news about social media sites leaking users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Everything we type on social media sites is recorded on the server and then transferred to companies for spying and advertising .
Although it may look like there are no laws and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
You are not only controlled by the government laws but also spied on by the government .
In conclusion , everything has two sides of the story .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
To utilize the technology well , we should make an effort to not only balance the pros and cons but also maximize the pros and minimize the cons .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our and the next generation .
With the widespread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular .
Connecting on social media such as Facebook and Twitter has become a main trend as well as a daily activity nowadays .
With this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily lives .
On one hand , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to get in contact with each other anytime and anywhere .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on a holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media makes it possible to have interaction by keeping writing comments .
When our phones are accidentally disconnected , we can also use social media to contact our friends .
Some people who are trying to talk in public can also actively take part in group chatting via social media .
Besides , we can make more friends through such interactions when our friends also bring their friends .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites has made it more convenient for people to update their friends ' statuses and contact their friends more frequently .
On the other hand , we need to rethink the influences brought by social media .
There are still many disadvantages of using social media .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affected by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
While social media brings convenience to people 's lives , people are increasingly willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face chatting which has a time and place requirement .
People who are not good at public speaking may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their interpersonal skills can never be improved under this situation .
Secondly , people 's over-reliance may inadvertently , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over-dependence on virtual social networking .
More and more networking has been transferred from real life to the internet .
This is a potential danger for teenagers growing up with social changes to get hurt .
Thirdly , a lot of updating of luxury living standards as well as other show-off situations may make people 's daily life more and more grandiloquent , which is not an accurate social growth trend .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addiction and their studying and working may be greatly influenced .
Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend of using social media may still last for a long time .
Therefore , whenever we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of social media .
In this sophisticated era , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
Geographical and transportation barriers are no longer a problem because communication and information technologies have been continuously enhanced .
Telephones may be perceived as a big innovation ever since the first time Graham Bell introduced them .
However , since the Internet was known , telephones started to give way to social media sites .
Many advantages are given to the users .
Let us take examples from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
Through Facebook , people are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances .
This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particulars and address may change from time to time , while on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo as an identifier .
Facebook is like a combination of messaging and chat services , personal profiles , media for sharing , and other entertainment add-ons ( i.e.
Social games allow users to communicate with remote people and also to update and express themselves at the same time .
Twitter , which has more simplified functions compared to Facebook , gives more benefits if used as an information sharing medium .
Twitter only allows users to give updates that are limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast , so that only highlighted messages are delivered .
For Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded , long notes can be published , and even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays .
These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .
Despite the luxuries offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize beforehand .
Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people who are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
As a consequence , it affects their interpersonal skills .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say , but in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth , even if not well-arranged , is a reflection of your personality .
This skill requires practice and can not be done completely through social media .
There is a situation where a family is having dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadgets , posting pictures on Facebook , updating statuses on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
These social media serve a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries but it does n't mean that surrounding people are neglected as a result .
This is related to the interpersonal skills that were mentioned before , which can be diminished qualitatively if we are accustomed to facing gadgets instead of facing human beings .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected parts of our lives , we build a " false image " in public .
We tend to only share our happy moments on social media .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problems at all .
Other people are then influenced by us and tend to do the same .
As a result , people think lowly of themselves and this may lead to depression and mental disorders .
It also reduces our empathy .
This is a serious social problem and it affects a lot of people .
As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does n't always provide advantages .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize .
It is up to people 's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take .
So , we should never forget to think of and calculate the benefits and losses of every decision that we make .
Nowadays , the advancement of technology has greatly improved the lives of many people .
In most countries , there has been an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Many people think that social media sites have benefits on communication between people , while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society .
One of the advantages carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before .
In the past decades , before social media sites were fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone or even a letter .
However , calling a person using a phone and writing a person a letter requires some cost , and sending a letter to a person who lives far away , especially in villages , takes a lot of time .
The appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on communication , and it only takes a few seconds for the message to reach .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they have not seen for a very long time , such as their friends from primary and secondary school .
As we graduate from school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , so we are not able to find them through a phone call or letter .
If phone and letter are the only way to contact them , we would probably not be able to find them .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connections between us and our old friends .
Hence , the social media sites serve as a platform for connection .
Everything that comes with benefits will also have its disadvantages .
On the other hand , social media sites also bring some negative impacts to people and society .
The advancement of those social media sites makes people so reliant on them that some of them would rather prefer using those sites to contact each other than talking to each other face to face .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem caused by social media sites .
The use of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn lead to the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
As we all know , interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas .
The loss of interpersonal skills results in people 's inability to present their ideas well .
As a result , they will gradually decrease their ability to compete with each other in society .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
As part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies , and learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of those technologies .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to stay in touch with people and latest news has become a tremendous demand .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
With more than a billion users from all over the world , social media sites have clearly demonstrated their success in playing an important part in our lives .
However , there are arguments that social media life brings about a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
All users need an internet connection and an email account so that they can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life .
Secondly , it helps people to stay in touch with one another .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people around in real life .
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and bring people closer .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click of the refresh button .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people together by allowing us to create our own groups , pages , or sites to share our hobbies , interests , and studies on particular subjects .
Thus , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our globally interconnected world .
However , social media sites also have a second side of negative impact on humans .
Undeniably , it becomes more addictive when we spend more time busily socializing and interacting virtually .
We spend the majority of our time on sites like Facebook , Twitter , and it affects our daily work productivity and performance .
In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees from spending their office time on their personal leisure rather than concentrating on their work .
Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media networks also brings in a bad impact for us in the long term .
The more time we spend on these sites , the less time we spend interacting with one another face-to-face .
Hence , it lessens valuable interaction between humans and time spent away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
In addition , there are also some false reports and fake IDs occurring on both social media sites wherein people use fake IDs to insult or harass someone , such as the case of Heather Chua that occurred recently on Facebook .
These malicious comments often go viral and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user in real life , which might lead to an unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life by the victim .
In conclusion , everything has its two-sided effect and it depends on how we exploit it .
With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more tech-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites ; however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction , as it plays an even more important role in our lives .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook , and Weibo have become ubiquitous , seamless , and imperative in our life , people may worry about the young generation having problems with face-to-face communication skills .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions .
Social media enables us to explore the world far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and taking a one-week holiday .
The convenience is beyond description .
With a small smartphone or a computer at school , at work , or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a click and get to know about their lives through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos , and statuses .
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversations are easier for strangers to open up to one another .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
Moreover , people usually like to share candidly about their true feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 ; 80 % of information posted online is true while a person may only like 3 out of 10 times in real life .
This shows that a Facebook friend may know more about you than a close friend who does not have a Facebook account .
That is because we are acting as we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world .
Although sometimes those genuine shares of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as prevalent use of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments , we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulations of content online .
Another advantage of social media is aiding the spread of democracy .
People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments .
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what is actually happening around them .
One of the examples are the 2012 riots that happened in Egypt and Zambia .
The idea of searching for democracy was quickly passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia through the use of social media .
However , as the government controls most of the media .
These social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public .
For example , in the 2012 Singapore General Election , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of Facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
Despite this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional media .
Intensive use of social media does reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people are sitting together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
What we can do is educate the public about the importance of having friends at their side and teach them to manage their time well .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages for our daily lives .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage the words we use online .
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better place .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
Thanks to social media , communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
Apart from the ease of communication despite the distance , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trade can be done through social media as well .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear such as a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issues , as well as potential frauds that can be done through social media .
Twitter , Facebook , and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
Through those sites , we are able to talk to them , know what their activities are , and who their friends are , etc . From a surface-level point of view , it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well . That is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media accounts ; for example , Channel News Asia has a Twitter account and will update its followers with headline news .
That shows how news and information can actually be easily shared through social media .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , this information can reach them easily without them needing to watch or listen to the news reports .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people have started doing business through these sites .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook , whether it is our friends selling their products or professional brands selling their products online ; we can buy and contact the sellers through these sites , which can be considered an advantage for us as buyers .
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them in person ?
I do think there is a difference , and I believe many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our true feelings and may not be ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us .
Additionally , sometimes messages from one party can not be properly conveyed to the other because communication is done through written language , and thus the ' tone ' of the message sent and received can be interpreted differently .
Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online , but in real life , some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all .
This will lead to bad interpersonal skills as well as a trust issue .
Nowadays we ca n't really trust new people whom we know from social media since we 'll never know whether they are even ' real ' .
Some people fake their identities on media sites so that they can meet more people or some may even deceive others .
In addition , privacy issues have become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually be sharing some information that they were not initially willing to share .
Therefore , while social media sites undoubtedly have benefits in our lives , we should consider their drawbacks and thus use them wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and minimize their disadvantages as much as possible .
It is a common scene that almost everyone on public transport is watching their phone or wearing a pair of earbuds in today 's modern society .
Not only one , but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human evolution .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order to connect with others even from different countries .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communication skills which is important in their workplace .
This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can easily reach one another , even without contact for a long time .
In this fast-paced and competitive world , people may not be able to keep in touch with others .
With the help of social media sites , people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scenes and they can be updated on the new information of their friends .
Personally , I am studying overseas ; my busy study life keeps me away from contacting my old friends .
Using a common social media site with my friends to help me keep up with their statuses nowadays .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I converse with them .
In Singapore , many Malaysians cross the sea to work here .
Many of them are busy with work and separated from their children .
One of the managers at my workplace has the same situation .
After my manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchildren .
Therefore , my manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
People get connected or become closer with the same preferences .
It is easier for people to approach one another after knowing the information .
Students can exchange their experiences in studying even if they are in different countries .
People are able to share culture or pretty photos online , so others can spread the joy with them .
Thus , I believe that social media sites are a useful tool to help people get to know each other better .
However , social media sites are a double-edged sword ; they also have some negative effects on our daily lives .
One of the disadvantages that many people concern is that people lose interest in face-to-face communication .
Many people like to use language to pretend , and lose confidence when they talk to each other .
Although not everyone is good at public relations even without the existence of social media sites , we can not deny that it does affect some people 's ability in interpersonal skills .
In conclusion , the shadow always exists when there is light .
We should take advantage of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
Social media sites are supposed to be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people closer in this globalized world .
The use of social media has greatly influenced our ways of communicating with one another .
Online friends became real-life friends and real-life friends communicate with one another online .
Social media has profoundly changed our ways of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships .
There are advantages and disadvantages to this change .
Social media has reshaped the way of communication .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equals .
We share ideas , stories , and forge friendships based on mutual respect .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening " .
When we use Facebook and post pictures and statuses .
We are actively presenting facades of our lives in front of others .
We tend to post pictures with our best looks and statuses that are funny .
We broadcast these facades of ourselves to others .
The images we chose to present are tentatively considered .
The audience is not a specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
On the other hand , the viewers are not the listeners .
They are just scrolling through pages and pages of pictures and statuses and seeing one of them that they might think is funny .
It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about , but the content .
This type of communication does not help forge interpersonal relationships .
In real life , establishing friendship requires an all-rounded understanding of one another and caring for one another .
The latter requires face-to-face interaction where we can show our emotions to the other .
One can not truly understand a person by only stalking their Facebook page where they carefully choose what to present .
One can not truly show their emotions to another by texting some :) signs .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not conducive to fostering relationships .
However , it is good for sharing information .
On social media , everyone is both a broadcaster and a viewer .
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore ; because I can easily get news from my friends ' statuses .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some political newspapers or public figures .
I get news about sales , clothes , and cosmetics from my friends .
If some of my friends have horrible taste in clothes and they post them often , I can simply block them off .
Information was circulated .
The most popular information gets circulated the most so I can seldom miss it .
Social networks play a role in providing and filtering information .
This saves me a lot of time when reading newspapers and watching TV .
Personally , I feel more at ease on social media .
From the above two points of view , I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships .
With the help of social media , I became real-life friends with those from online forums with whom I shared the same interests .
I also discovered some of my friends ' interests which I find common with myself , so talking to one another is much more about life , studies , friends , etc .
The communication does not focus on how we feel or say to each other , but whatever is interesting or the content .
In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress someone , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
There are advantages and disadvantages in itself ; however , whether it is good or bad , we are still not sure .
It is just different .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
People living in the modern world really can not live without social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Almost all students and young adults possess a Facebook or Twitter account .
It is true that social media makes it more convenient for people to connect with one another .
However , it seems that , especially for some , sharing some parts of their lives , such as videos and photos , on the social media sites has become really necessary .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered : a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on their social media sites .
Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
People used to write letters and send postcards to keep in touch with loved ones who lived far away from them in the past .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the message .
Nowadays , what people need to do is just type in front of the computer in their own rooms .
And people on the other side will only take a second to receive the message .
Distance and time are no longer a problem , which is convenient especially when an instant chat is needed .
However , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them , their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost .
Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered a form of communication .
When people chat on those media sites , there is no eye contact , no emotional delivery , and even expressions are typed in using some combinations of punctuations .
For convenience , sentences are shortened to three or four words such as " lol " ( which means " laugh out loud " ) and " asap " ( which means " as soon as possible " ) .
People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
While , once they are communicating with people face-to-face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes a big problem .
Social media also provides people a huge amount of information about people and things that they are interested in .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you admire such as famous movie and series stars , businessmen and entrepreneurs .
It makes people feel extremely close to their admirers ' lives and works .
Updated news people care about can easily be obtained by refreshing your social media sites on your smartphone and laptop frequently .
However , after one has registered on those social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be used against you in the future .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media sites is honest .
The profile picture may not be the person that user says he or she really is .
The reason might just be that they want to " decorate " their face .
But there is a possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you .
No pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
It shortens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information using social media .
On the contrary , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and makes people risk exposing their privacy to those whose identity can not be verified on the social media sites .
How does social media help change our lives ?
As technology develops , social media has taken on an increasingly significant role in the world .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a lot of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives better .
However , it also raised concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it at the same time reduces the chances for us to talk to our friends face to face , which may affect our interpersonal skills .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being .
Many people say they will support social media since it really helps them to have a closer view of how their friends are doing in other parts of the world .
This is especially true for people who are overseas .
To them , social media is the only resource they can use to find out what is happening in their home country and to show their lives to their loved ones .
What 's more , these days social media plays an important role in spreading information .
Nowadays , people can easily put their rental information on their Facebook account and wait for responses from people from different parts of the world , bringing a huge amount of convenience .
It is quite significant , especially for young teenagers , since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what is happening in the world than read the newspaper every day .
However , there are also a great number of people who are against this technology .
They worry a lot about the negative effects on the teenagers who are still developing themselves .
They pointed out that social media actually reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
The more we care about Facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see at some parties , people would prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on Facebook if they feel bored .
It makes people worry because if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will decrease their ability to talk to people .
They will find it difficult to find topics to communicate with other people .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages compared to the advantages it gives us .
Although it is useful when we need to show others that we lead a good life , it also wastes a lot of our time .
Think another way , if we put the time we spend wandering on those sites to use , we may have already finished one book or done other more meaningful things .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact our family or friends .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use them wisely no matter whether it is really good or not .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media platforms .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely instead of abusing it , we will all live a better life .
The advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Nowadays , as technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily lives .
You can see people playing on Facebook , Twitter through their smartphones or iPads on buses or on trains .
Some may say that the prevalence of these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
First of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
Years ago , when these modern products were not popular , the ways for people to communicate or contact people far away were still restricted to making phone calls , sending emails , or writing letters .
Some will take a long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response .
However , social media solves these problems well .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get a reply very quickly .
The communication is not limited to words .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions .
People can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts online .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situations and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites .
These social media make people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
However , social media may cause some harm to people 's lives .
It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicating face to face , thus affecting their interpersonal skills .
Some people spend a lot of time on it and forget their real life .
Actually , I have seen some people be very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
However , they act quite bored when I talk to them in real life .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal and social skills as they are growing up .
If they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems for their mental development .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face-to-face .
Some may share less and less time with their family and not know how to express themselves .
Moreover , some incorrect values on websites will affect teenagers and confuse them .
Some may even do something wrong .
In conclusion , the emergence of social media sites is a double-edged sword .
It can make our lives simpler .
People can promote their friendship and relationships through these social media .
Additionally , it can also make people forget to communicate with their family and friends in real life and negatively affect their interpersonal skills .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh its disadvantages .
So , we need to make the best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring .
And try to bypass the shortcomings .
Remember to send greetings to our friends and family regularly .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely .
People can know what their friends look like recently and interesting things happening in their lives just by checking their Facebook or other social media sites .
We can not deny that social media sites truly make it possible for old friends to retain information and to communicate with each other , even when in different countries .
However , social media sites truly reduce face-to-face communication , which truly affects interpersonal skills .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using social media in people 's daily life .
First , social media sites can connect people with their friends and family more closely .
By typing the words and showing the pictures , people can express emotions that they are too shy to express .
For example , on Mother 's Day , people might be too shy to say " I love you " to their mothers , so they can type it on their mother 's Facebook page .
Then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warmth .
On the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the Internet is the only way that he can communicate with their parents and friends .
Therefore , social media is truly beneficial for people .
Secondly , social media sites can not only connect people closely with their friends .
People can also get much information about celebrities on Twitter and Facebook such as Obama and Bill Gates , and they can get first-hand study materials from them .
They can learn how these people have succeeded and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous persons ' thoughts through the use of social media .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or people who need money to cure a disease can get help from the world quickly . Once one person knows the information , they will share it to their " friends area " , then many people will know it and spread the information to the person who can give help .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the proliferation of social media .
Firstly , when people rely on social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will become accustomed to communicating by typing instead of talking .
People even prefer talking to their friends and meeting their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication .
Therefore , social media truly limits interpersonal skills such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and connect with their friends .
Secondly , without meaningful communication in real life , people lose the ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood .
There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages ; however , in real life , they may not have jobs or be living in poverty .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheated and lose money even if they are safe .
Therefore , social media is not safe , which is bad for teenagers ' future development .
All in all , the emergence of social media truly helps people in many areas .
However , there are some disadvantages which will affect people to some degree .
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily Lives and Society .
Nowadays , with the development of technology and society , social media has become more popular and even important in our daily lives .
We communicate with others using social media , such as Twitter , Facebook and microblogs more and more frequently .
There is no need for people to go out of their home to interact with others ; they can chat online , share pictures , tell others what they have done , or tell funny stories .
It seems that people build good relationships with others through social media , but problems can arise .
People do not know how to talk to others face to face , especially strangers .
Then , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : it 's more convenient to contact others , and it 's easier to know about others .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others via social media .
In old days , if one wanted to tell some important news to another one who lived far away , he needed to write letters and it wasted time .
The long distance and time-consuming nature made spreading the messages very difficult at that time .
Therefore , people may not contact with their faraway friends and relatives unless it is something important .
However , people now can contact anyone all over the world who can use a computer at any time , and there is no delay in messages .
The other advantage is that it is easier to learn about others through social media .
If there were no social media , it would be difficult for people to know about a stranger .
They may collect information about that person by asking their friends , colleagues , or family members .
And the information collected may not be accurate and true .
Unlike today , with the help of social media , people can easily get the information they want just by searching online , and know what that person did every day at what time .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life , wasting time , causing illnesses related to sitting for long periods of time in front of the computer , quickly spreading rumors and fake news , and most importantly , making people lose the ability to confidently talk to others face to face .
It is strange that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk to each other .
If there is a joke on their Facebook page , they may talk to others in this way , " Hi , look how ridiculous this is , " then they laugh together .
No matter if it is a party , dinner , or just a simple get-together , there are always some people who bow their heads and play with their phones even though their family and friends are in front of them .
In conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media while being aware of the disadvantages and try their best to avoid them happening to them , their friends , and family .
Today 's world is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter which are attractively connecting people around the world .
However , some people worry that social networks can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated as follows .
Nobody can deny the advantages of social media , as the benefits it provides in connecting people regardless of nationality , race , culture , and language .
Social media is a trending channel and a suitable means of communication .
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world .
It has erased the boundaries of distance and time .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
Nowadays , thanks to the help of social media , with just one click , you can contact your family and friends wherever you want .
You can share photos , videos , and meaningful experiences of your life .
More importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media .
Secondly , social media networks open the door of opportunities for people due to their great benefits in connecting .
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends , and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
In the business arena , social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services .
On the other hand , social media also has disadvantages which have created worries for the society recently and made it a controversial phenomenon .
More and more young people tend to live in the social media world most of their time and reduce face-to-face human contact , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life .
First and foremost , we should realize that the social media world is not trustworthy and real .
Everyone can easily create the personality and characteristics they want .
They can become anyone they choose .
Though social media can create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
There is a story of a girl who has lived in the social media world for eight years every night .
In the chat room , she created close relationships with eight people .
She talked with them every night , trusted them , and shared her life with them .
Then eventually , she discovered that one person was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness .
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crime and deception .
People can use the information to deceive family and friends and banks to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft , and so on .
Last but not least , social media does affect human interpersonal skills when people increase their time on social sites and reject chances to expose themselves to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less ambitious they become .
As a result , if the situation continues in this unexpected trend , it will have a negative effect on the younger generation .
To put it in a nutshell , everything has its own pros and cons .
So do social media networks .
It not only is convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing business , but it can also damage people 's relationships and interpersonal skills .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people 's potential to the fullest .

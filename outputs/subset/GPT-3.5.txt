On the one hand , we do not want this potential danger to cause frightening effects in our families ' lives later on .
When people around us know that we have certain diseases , their attitudes will easily change , whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us .
After all , what affects one family may or may not affect another even though the families have a common genetic makeup , shared by either of the parents .
Should someone who suffered from this disease keep it a secret or inform their relatives ?
In retrospect , it is also one 's duty to ensure that he or she undergo periodic health checks .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assist those at risk to make informed decisions about disclosure .
Whose duty it is to inform at-risk relatives or not greatly depends on their personal morality and the nature of how ' directive ' the risk is to them .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicate their high chance of carrying certain diseases .
Therefore , keeping the information secret from their future spouse would help the relationship .
First , in the case of marriage , people should be honest and tell their spouse they may carry certain genetic risks that may affect their offspring .
For example , if a carrier is told that they have a risk of developing diabetes .
Otherwise , if the other parties were unaware , they may end up having diabetes in the future without any prevention .
In conclusion , we could tell that the benefits of informing genetic risk carriers ' relatives outweigh the costs .
Genetic disorders may or may not be hereditary diseases and it is sometimes hard to find out if one has these kinds of diseases .
From the legal aspect , the answer is no , but from the ethical aspect , the answer should be yes .
Firstly , someone 's type of disease is their own private matter .
If a law requires someone to divulge their privacy , especially when they are not willing to do so .
It is against their human rights and it is contrary to the spirit of the law .
If you only say you need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of the law .
How can a law made by the government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potential disease ?
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make it harder for the carrier to digest the fat and salt in the blood , which can cause hypertension .
They can build a daily habit of eating less salt and fat and thus avoid hypertension .
By doing so , fewer of their loved ones will suffer from the genetic problem .
Therefore , some carriers will have the opinion of keeping it a secret .
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden to anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases , given in the context of current medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is detected in the early stage .
In conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the relatives of the risk of getting the same genetic disease .
Early preparation for examinations is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile , or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorders due to their young age .
Furthermore , the act of informing others without the consent of their parents or the patients themselves could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Therefore , much thought needs to be put on the immediate family , as it could cause a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members themselves .
Some families may feel hurt with regards to their family pride or reputation , upon having knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic diseases is vital , as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorders .
Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial for their emotional well-being .
A person with a disorder , regardless of whether it is a mental or physical disorder , is always easily noticed by their family .
Genetic disorders are inherited generation by generation , but not all of the offspring show the relevant symptoms .
As a result , the family generation stops at the moment the adult carrier announces his issue .
The reason behind is that after WWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encouraged the people to give birth more often .
He has to choose between protecting his family or making his family more prosperous with a potential generic risk .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by others because they will not understand the position and duty of the caregiver in the family .
In conclusion , people should think carefully about the consequences of telling their relatives about their genetic disorder issues .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on their own .
Other than that , I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support for the career .
I find that it is important to inform , especially if it is contagious , so the carrier can prevent the disease from spreading to society .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lot of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden to her family .
She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in the family .
However , we will never know whether these negative effects will happen when the carrier decides to tell his or her family of their condition .
In conclusion , personally I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform their family members about the issue .
However , I believe that the carrier has the right not to disclose any information but has responsibility to take action to prevent any ethical dilemma .
If the result turned out to be something that the carrier can not accept , then it would have been better not to know the truth .
After realizing that they are the carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in a family due to the fact and creates more unhappiness in the family .
Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives , but he has no obligation to tell still .
On the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the disability .
I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is , without having emotional stress .
Debates have been around for years as to whether a carrier for a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform their relatives .
This is an issue that needs to be addressed , as there is a family-related ethical dilemma involved .
We were crying hard but we were not alone , it 's our family and relatives who raised us .
Hence , they should be the people we should be grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy with .
By doing so , one will feel less stressed in facing such risk of disorder .
In conclusion , in order to avoid family-related ethical dilemmas , it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform their relatives .
More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing at such a junction of whether or not he / she should inform the relatives .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
However , it leads to a new problem : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
However , there is still a diversity of points of view among the people .
Frequently , the intention of the carriers is not to tell their families and to continue their own lives without the anxiety of their families .
Demons are not easily defeated and it requires a lot of energy and psychological support .
Furthermore , the risks posed by known genetic disorders are so serious that they can not be described .
Without their concern and support , we would have been hard-pressed to stay until this time .
It is the ethical duty of hospital staff to keep the secret of any patients .
However , hospitals can provide a counselor to advise the carrier about the actions that can be taken .
However , there may be some special cases that are hard to define .
The individual is responsible for balancing their own interests and the benefits of family and society .
It is a hard decision to make , but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for the career and families in the future .
First of all , from the perspective of human rights , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
They may not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it a secret and not let others know about it .
Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier .
If they do n't want to think too much about it and view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility .
This obeys their own will as in they have to accept the truth which may make their subsequent life miserable .
For a carrier of a genetic disorder to know that they are carriers , it causes more dilemma than getting the disorder .
There are four reasons why people do n't have to be shy and share their problems regarding genetic disorders .
The more people ( relatives ) who know about her problem , the more information channels are provided .
Unlike people with high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism are prone to sunburn and other skin diseases .
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
Usually , people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene , and this may lead to circulatory problems such as blood clotting .
Fourthly , it is important for the parents to give mental support to their children with genetic disorders .
In this modern world , technologies have improved a lot compared to the last century .
The medical authorities claimed that only individuals at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma arises .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell their relatives about this .
This is because their relatives have the right to know about this .
Every family member has their own right to know what is going on with them .
If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this explain their plight ?
Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent , he should know what is likely to be going on for him .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their relatives .
Not long ago , the Human Genome Project sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) has been started .
In my opinion , patients who are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
Without the support of loved ones , a patient 's life is no better than death .
A study from New York University in 2010 showed that patients with family members around generally recovered 2-4 days faster than those taken care of by professional nurses .
Hence , for a family in which every member truly believes in and loves each other , all these troubles are just testimonies to make them stronger .
In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic disorder .
Furthermore , since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is up to the person 's call to tell the relatives about it .
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
With the advancement of technology , a new life with genetic risks can be detected .
This essay will discuss the reasons why relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have genetic risks .
The situation may become worse if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy burden named medication fees .
Another reason why parents should be aware if their baby is a carrier of genetic risk is for the nation 's good .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disabled , such as providing medical subsidies and building special schools to educate them .
By not increasing the number of disabled people in a nation , the government is able to concentrate on developing in other ways , such as military and education .
Moreover , in the world we are living in today , many miscarriages are conducted in hospitals every day .
Therefore , I believe the parents have the right to know the health of their child .
Many people may support the theory that everyone has the right to enjoy the world , especially people of faith .
However , the problem is , will people really enjoy their life if they have to stay in the hospital every day and with all the needles and endless pain ?
One should have full control of their information and it is their right to decide whether or not to disclose it to someone else .
If a person has a disease C that might be a result of gene A.
There are possible negative consequences that people might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relatives .
They might even be advised not to get married or have children .
After he took the test and was obligated to tell his relatives , everyone knew that he was a carrier .
If a gene runs in the family , and one of the family members tests positive , who do they need to tell ?
In less than a week , half of the town knows that person A has a risk gene , and his family might be a genetically risky family .
Nowadays , people not only pursue the comfort of their own lives , but also a better development of their future generations .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your own wellness and the health of your relatives , and the second is being responsible for future generations .
The awareness of your relatives and family about your genetic risk is good for your self-wellness and the health of your relatives .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger .
If you have n't undergone the genetic testing , it 's just a guess and fate for what will happen to both of you and your relatives .
However , if you have undergone testing and are aware that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert and avoid getting the disease .
Therefore , telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent getting the disease is your responsibility .
Furthermore , you are also being responsible for your future generations by informing them of the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk .
However , if you are honest with your wife and family , you give them the chance to choose whether to have a child or not .
And in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing that genetic testing in the first place .
Many people feel that we should inform our relatives since we really care about their health status .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits , such as eating less sugar-containing food and keeping a good mood .
The earlier we tell them , the better habits they will develop and the better they will be for the rest of their lives .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try to make it a positive experience .
It is only after we tell them that they will start paying attention to their health .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of some potential disease .
As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass the genetics to their family members .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying a risky gene , other members of his or her family may also have the risk of disease .
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble and save much time for proper treatment .
Sometimes lives may even be saved if they are told early and receive timely treatment .
So for the consideration of the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
Secondly , it can avoid genetic diseases passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies .
Some genetic genes will be passed on only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to their spouse , another life may risk inheriting the genetic disease .
On the one hand , it can tell members of the carrier 's family about the possible diseases they may have and can provide timely treatment if possible .
However , I thought that genetic information is a person 's personal privacy which should be protected by the law .
First , the information concerning genetics is something personally , which is also a privacy like people 's bank card key .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family and even break the relationship between children and adults .
Once their family or relatives know that the person does not have a relationship with them .
However happy they were before , there would be some barriers that appear which would truly destroy the family gradually .
The relationship between parents and their children should not be tested only genetically ; it is something much deeper and tighter .
More and more illnesses are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of medical technology .
People will know whether they carry a disease in their genes after they have had the genetic test .
But they are all from one family and have the same forefather , then of course they have the same genes in some part .
I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the right to know the result .
It is just because you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever but when it is revealed , the more shocking and upsetting it will be .
That plays an important role in allowing relatives to overcome the discrimination of society and anxiety about the risks .
It can be very difficult for them , but necessary for the carriers and their families .
And now I have over 500 friends on Facebook and bury myself with hundreds of messages every day .
Instead , we will post a message and tag our friends to inform about these changes .
It is becoming even more convenient than talking through the phone since it is free .
We discussed everything we liked and we had more personal space . Our friends also had more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
And actually lots of rescue jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people who get lost and so on .
With more convenient and humane communications , the relationship between the government and people has greatly improved .
Even when we gather together , more people find themselves with fewer topics to talk about than before and choose to dive into their social media again .
Additionally , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travel experiences .
For myself , I am longing to some places after I saw those beautiful pictures taken by my friends .
Social media makes our lives so fast-paced and leaves us less time to think about our lives .
The burgeoning of social media definitely has its stint ; but amongst all good things , it is better to have them in moderation .
The recipient will then receive the information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network .
In the past , vast communication was done through one of the many such methods as telegram , snail mail , and poor-quality voice calls .
Meeting and interacting for talks allows one to be closer to the recipient .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utilizes the motor , thinking , and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate .
Unlike the use of social media , most interaction is done through thinking and typing .
As a result , one does not train the necessary parts of the skills required for proper interpersonal relationships .
It is also entirely incorrect to blame social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skills .
Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance with utilizing tests , and ranked .
The types of use must also be taken note of-informing , interacting , discussing , and others .
At the same time , it improves interpersonal skills through dynamic practices between individuals and real-time presence .
In the days before the social networks , people may not have had the chance to know others from different countries or those they had never met before .
The number of people they know may be limited only to the people they meet in daily life , such as classmates and working partners .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of communication .
The largest negative impact is that due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on the internet every minute .
They take too much time using online social networks and thus do not have time to meet people in person in their daily lives .
It not only affects interpersonal skills but it is also bad for people 's health if they spend too much time on social media .
It provides people with a more convenient contact environment and improves the frequency of meetings .
The world is increasingly becoming more interconnected by all kinds of social network websites such as Facebook and Twitter .
We can even know what a friend who is thousands of miles away is eating for lunch through these kinds of social media .
From some points of view , social media really has a lot of advantages by allowing us to communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends over the phone , we can keep up with their latest news by scanning the webpage .
It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personalities by reading things they put on social network media .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk to each other but just look at their cellphones .
This kind of behavior is not good for people 's psychological health according to research .
Cyber communication is quite different from face-to-face communication , and people who rely too much on cyber communication will not get used to real-life communication .
With the willingness of people to be the best among others , social networking sites now become a place to show off .
It is a mental health issue and it may trigger people , especially teenagers , to become materialistic .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication faster than ever before .
This essay will discuss both the benefits and downsides of using social media in the contemporary society .
Approximately 50 % of people have learned about breaking news from social media .
Furthermore , with current technology , smartphones are able to access social media sites , making it easier for consumers to use .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
This had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this had resulted in the temporary closure of schools .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information at a relatively fast speed .
Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent the spread of these hoaxes .
However , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social media movement .
In the past , people used to write letters to their friends and it would take a relatively long time to send the letter .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to keep in touch conveniently .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media .
With a globalized and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the main platforms for social interaction .
With just a touch away from any media / electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with their friends without much hassle .
Thus , long distance relationships or friendships can be maintained and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier .
The society will adapt to such phenomena as physical interactions are transformed into cyber interactions .
We can not be certain of the reliability or truth of some posts or information we receive through the Internet .
Photos and information retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit certain personal agendas .
The danger of such social media is the uncertainty of communication due to lack of physical interaction .
People use Twitter to follow the artists or celebrities they love and Facebook to see their friends ' recent activity .
Nevertheless , they can still use phones to make normal calls and send messages to contact .
Several arguments have been made regarding social media , which actually has some inevitable disadvantages for people .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or the internet .
Generally , people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phones or computers and their fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
The children nowadays do not know what neighborhood games are and who is staying beside them , all they know is pressing icons on the screens .
These are some concrete examples of how social media reduces face-to-face human contact .
When people get used to using social media to contact other people , what will happen is that their interpersonal communication skills will degrade and be lost eventually .
Firstly , they have lost the courage to meet strangers , not even the courage to talk .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people face-to-face and will not be trained in conversation skills .
As a result , social media helps them to do their jobs , but it indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
Social media does have some other advantages besides its general benefits to human beings .
First of all , people save money by using the internet to contact other people and read news .
Secondly , people make friends all over the world and are able to easily update their friends on their recent activity .
A guy who is going to travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activities .
In conclusion , social media benefits people in several ways , but at the same time , it harms people .
People should avoid the misuse of social media and use it in the proper way .
It started with the invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
In the past , we traveled by ship and now we can use airplanes to do so .
From the example I mentioned earlier , we can see that the distance between us and our loved ones is getting further apart .
Social media sites such as Facebook have allowed us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
Social media is beneficial as it connects you and your loved ones , even when separated by distance .
As I mentioned in the beginning , there are also disadvantages of social media tools .
One of them is that it reduces the level of concentration , especially among the youngsters .
This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their Facebook page as their friends post something new every second .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility for their own life by making the right decisions .
There are advantages and disadvantages to using social media sites , however in this case striking a balance between social media and life is the most important thing to do .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decreased .
As people feel more confident online , where they do not have to face people in real life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online .
This results in a lack of interpersonal skills in individuals , especially young students , as they always have the option to turn their back to real-life and go online .
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their sense of self-identity in real life and may not know how to interact with people in real life .
Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy are not reflected as something positive to the users .
However , such sparks of sudden attention are extremely short-term and easily gone , thus not adding any value or meaning to the user 's life .
However , the friendship in such virtual worlds is so superficial and not so relevant to real life .
Furthermore , this also possibly triggers privacy issues as Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to the information of the users .
As this happens , users are more and more prone to any possible frauds .
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter were born with the intention of connecting people from around the world .
The parents are now the " friends " of their kids , and they can now " follow " their kids more closely and in real time .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced face-to-face human contact , it eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
We may meet only once , but we exchanged our contact numbers as well as Facebook accounts in order to keep in touch .
Within clicks , we could check our friend 's profile and read on for their updates .
This allows friends who may not have time to meet up to still remain connected in some way .
Nonetheless , what seems to connect us can be the cause that drives us apart .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is that there is a reduction in face-to-face contact .
For example , we tend to send birthday wishes when Facebook prompts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings , but social media sites are tools to enhance them .
However , there are also some disadvantages that occur due to the use of social media in society .
Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily lives .
Through social media sites , we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in other sectors which benefit the company more and boost up its profits .
That is why facial expression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
In addition , " social media sites will affect writing skills " is the point of view in society .
Based on the statistics report , writing skills will be reduced more when more time is used on social media sites .
I believe most of us have experienced suddenly forgetting how to write a word that we should know .
Writing is an essential skill for people who express their own feelings and opinions .
However , there is news about social media sites leaking users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
To utilize the technology well , we should make an effort to not only balance the pros and cons but also maximize the pros and minimize the cons .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our and the next generation .
With this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily lives .
When our phones are accidentally disconnected , we can also use social media to contact our friends .
Some people who are trying to talk in public can also actively take part in group chatting via social media .
Besides , we can make more friends through such interactions when our friends also bring their friends .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites has made it more convenient for people to update their friends ' statuses and contact their friends more frequently .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affected by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
People who are not good at public speaking may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their interpersonal skills can never be improved under this situation .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addiction and their studying and working may be greatly influenced .
Telephones may be perceived as a big innovation ever since the first time Graham Bell introduced them .
Let us take examples from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
Facebook is like a combination of messaging and chat services , personal profiles , media for sharing , and other entertainment add-ons ( i.e.
Twitter , which has more simplified functions compared to Facebook , gives more benefits if used as an information sharing medium .
Despite the luxuries offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize beforehand .
Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people who are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected parts of our lives , we build a " false image " in public .
Nowadays , the advancement of technology has greatly improved the lives of many people .
In most countries , there has been an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Many people think that social media sites have benefits on communication between people , while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on communication , and it only takes a few seconds for the message to reach .
If phone and letter are the only way to contact them , we would probably not be able to find them .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connections between us and our old friends .
On the other hand , social media sites also bring some negative impacts to people and society .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem caused by social media sites .
The loss of interpersonal skills results in people 's inability to present their ideas well .
Thus , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our globally interconnected world .
However , social media sites also have a second side of negative impact on humans .
We spend the majority of our time on sites like Facebook , Twitter , and it affects our daily work productivity and performance .
Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media networks also brings in a bad impact for us in the long term .
Social media enables us to explore the world far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and taking a one-week holiday .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
Moreover , people usually like to share candidly about their true feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off .
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what is actually happening around them .
Intensive use of social media does reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication .
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better place .
Thanks to social media , communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
I do think there is a difference , and I believe many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our true feelings and may not be ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us .
This will lead to bad interpersonal skills as well as a trust issue .
Nowadays we ca n't really trust new people whom we know from social media since we 'll never know whether they are even ' real ' .
Some people fake their identities on media sites so that they can meet more people or some may even deceive others .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order to connect with others even from different countries .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communication skills which is important in their workplace .
This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
Personally , I am studying overseas ; my busy study life keeps me away from contacting my old friends .
Using a common social media site with my friends to help me keep up with their statuses nowadays .
After my manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchildren .
People are able to share culture or pretty photos online , so others can spread the joy with them .
However , social media sites are a double-edged sword ; they also have some negative effects on our daily lives .
One of the disadvantages that many people concern is that people lose interest in face-to-face communication .
Many people like to use language to pretend , and lose confidence when they talk to each other .
We should take advantage of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
Social media sites are supposed to be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people closer in this globalized world .
The use of social media has greatly influenced our ways of communicating with one another .
Online friends became real-life friends and real-life friends communicate with one another online .
We are actively presenting facades of our lives in front of others .
We tend to post pictures with our best looks and statuses that are funny .
There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
They are just scrolling through pages and pages of pictures and statuses and seeing one of them that they might think is funny .
In real life , establishing friendship requires an all-rounded understanding of one another and caring for one another .
The latter requires face-to-face interaction where we can show our emotions to the other .
One can not truly understand a person by only stalking their Facebook page where they carefully choose what to present .
One can not truly show their emotions to another by texting some :) signs .
If some of my friends have horrible taste in clothes and they post them often , I can simply block them off .
The communication does not focus on how we feel or say to each other , but whatever is interesting or the content .
Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
People used to write letters and send postcards to keep in touch with loved ones who lived far away from them in the past .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the message .
And people on the other side will only take a second to receive the message .
Distance and time are no longer a problem , which is convenient especially when an instant chat is needed .
People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
While , once they are communicating with people face-to-face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes a big problem .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you admire such as famous movie and series stars , businessmen and entrepreneurs .
The reason might just be that they want to " decorate " their face .
No pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
As technology develops , social media has taken on an increasingly significant role in the world .
However , it also raised concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster .
What 's more , these days social media plays an important role in spreading information .
It makes people worry because if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will decrease their ability to talk to people .
You can see people playing on Facebook , Twitter through their smartphones or iPads on buses or on trains .
Some may say that the prevalence of these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get a reply very quickly .
People can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts online .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situations and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites .
These social media make people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicating face to face , thus affecting their interpersonal skills .
Actually , I have seen some people be very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
However , they act quite bored when I talk to them in real life .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal and social skills as they are growing up .
Additionally , it can also make people forget to communicate with their family and friends in real life and negatively affect their interpersonal skills .
So , we need to make the best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring .
People can know what their friends look like recently and interesting things happening in their lives just by checking their Facebook or other social media sites .
However , social media sites truly reduce face-to-face communication , which truly affects interpersonal skills .
By typing the words and showing the pictures , people can express emotions that they are too shy to express .
People even prefer talking to their friends and meeting their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication .
Secondly , without meaningful communication in real life , people lose the ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheated and lose money even if they are safe .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : it 's more convenient to contact others , and it 's easier to know about others .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others via social media .
The long distance and time-consuming nature made spreading the messages very difficult at that time .
Therefore , people may not contact with their faraway friends and relatives unless it is something important .
However , people now can contact anyone all over the world who can use a computer at any time , and there is no delay in messages .
In conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
Secondly , social media networks open the door of opportunities for people due to their great benefits in connecting .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends , and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
First and foremost , we should realize that the social media world is not trustworthy and real .
Though social media can create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
There is a story of a girl who has lived in the social media world for eight years every night .
She talked with them every night , trusted them , and shared her life with them .
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crime and deception .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less ambitious they become .
It not only is convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing business , but it can also damage people 's relationships and interpersonal skills .
